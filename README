This reopsitory contains the "more control and package management using
package users" document and helper scripts by Matthias S. Benkmann,
originally found as a hint for Linux From Scratch. The helper scripts
have been modified and adjusted so they work well for systems built
using the Cross-Built Linux (CBL) process.

The original version of the document is available on the Linux From
Scratch site:

The package users material should be the first thing installed into the
final CBL system -- before installing any other packages. Since the
package users scripts aren't available at the time that they're being
installed, CBL provides a blueprint that installs everything _as though_
it were already available.

The conventions used in CBL are: the install group is GID 9999, and
package users are set up to use UIDs and GIDs starting with 10000. (The
first package user is `package-users`, of course.)  For CBL we also
create an `ldconfig` user with UID and GID 9998 -- that isn't a package
user, but it exists so that package users can run `ldconfig` without
being privileged.

CBL also sets UID_MAX and GID_MAX in /etc/login.defs to 9997 so that
useradd and groupadd won't allocate values that are reserved for package
users, and removes the GROUP and CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL settings from the
useradd defaults.
