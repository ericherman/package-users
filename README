This reopsitory contains the "more control and package management using
package users" document and helper scripts by Matthias S. Benkmann,
originally found as a hint for Linux From Scratch and now modified and
adjusted so they work well as part of the Cross-Built Linux process and
system.

The original version of the document is available on the Linux From
Scratch site:

The package users material should be the first thing installed as a part
of the final CBL system -- before installing any other packages. Since
the package users scripts aren't available at the time that they're
being installed, CBL provides a blueprint that sets up the package users
files just as though they had been installed using the package users
framework.

The conventions used in CBL are: the install group is GID 9999, and
package users are set up to use UIDs and GIDs starting with 10000. (The
first package user is `package-users`, of course.)  For CBL we also
create an `ldconfig` user with UID and GID 9998; ldconfig isn't a
package user, it only exists so that any user in the "install" group can
run `ldconfig` without using sudo.

CBL also sets UID_MAX and GID_MAX in /etc/login.defs to 9997 so that
useradd and groupadd won't allocate values that are reserved for package
users, and removes the GROUP and CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL settings from the
useradd defaults.
