This is Random's modified version of the original Package Users
helper scripts from Matthias S Benkmann, described in the "more
control and package management using package users" LFS hint.

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/more_control_and_pkg_man.txt

You can use the Makefile here to install the initial Package
Users stuff -- have a look, it is not doing anything particularly
odd.  If you want to use the Makefile approach, you might have to
modify it first -- it assumes that the install group will be GID
9999, and the package users helpers will be installed as
"package-users" with UID and GID 10000.

You might want to modify UID_MAX and GID_MAX in /etc/login.defs
to 9997 so that useradd and groupadd won't allocate values in the
package users range. (User "ldconfig" is uid 9998 gid 9998)


TODO: 

these will help with automation...

- add an environment variable BUILD_DIR; default should be source 
  directory.  create (if necessary) and cd to BUILD_DIR before
  performing configure/make/test/install
- add function unpack_source
