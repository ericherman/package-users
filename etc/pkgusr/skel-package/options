# override CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, or other environment variables here

#
# If the package needs to be built from a directory other than
# the source directory, set BUILD_DIR appropriately (for example:
# 'BUILD_DIR=../build-binutils')
#
# You may copy a source tarball into a "src" subdirectory, and
# put patches into a "patches" subdirectory, in which case the
# build script will unpack and patch the source for you.
# Alternatively, you can prepare the source yourself (and cd into
# the source directory) before running build.
#
# If necessary, redefine the build functions: 
#   configure_commands, make_commands, test_commands, install_commands
#
# Look at ~/.bash_profile for syntax help.  Re-source the options
# file afterward!
#
# Run "declare -f" to find out the current function definitions.
#
# If you don't need to set anything here, just delete it entirely!
