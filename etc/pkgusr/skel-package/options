# override CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, or other environment variables here

#
# If the package needs to be built from a directory other than
# the source directory, set BUILD_DIR appropriately (for example:
# `export BUILD_DIR=../build-binutils`)
#
# You may copy a source tarball into a `src` subdirectory, and put
# patches into a `patches` subdirectory, in which case the build script
# will unpack and patch the source for you.  Alternatively, you can
# prepare the source yourself (and cd into the source directory) before
# running build.
#
# If necessary, redefine the build functions: configure_commands,
# make_commands, test_commands, install_commands
#
# If this package has external dependencies, such as requiring special
# users or groups to exist, verify that the dependencies are met in
# initial_checkup (this function should echo problem notifications and
# exit the build if they are not).
#
# Look at ~/.bash_profile for syntax help.  Re-source the options file
# after making any changes to it!
#
# Run "declare -f" to find out the current function definitions.
#
# If you don't need to set anything in the options file, you can just
# delete it entirely!
