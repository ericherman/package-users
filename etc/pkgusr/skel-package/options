# This is the default `options` file. Generally it will be overwritten
# by litbuild with the correct contents based on a blueprint.

# If you are not using litbuild:
#
# Override CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, or other environment variables here
# as needed.
#
# If the package needs to be built from a directory other than
# the source directory, set BUILD_DIR appropriately (for example:
# `export BUILD_DIR=../build-binutils`)
#
# You should copy a source tarball into a `src` subdirectory, and put
# patches into a `patches` subdirectory, in which case the build script
# will unpack and patch the source for you.
#
# These are default versions of the build functions (configure_commands,
# make_commands, test_commands, install_commands). Change them as
# needed.
